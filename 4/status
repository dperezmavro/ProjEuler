factorization done using fermat's method
	can be improved I think

Thanks to alexander B. for his great way of generating the palindromes and guidance on a different perspective 

possible improvements :
	better factorization
bugs :
	It gets stuck at the palindrome before 900009 (8....8, i am running those in decreasing order)
